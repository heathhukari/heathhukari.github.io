     <div class="intro">Welcome to the PC builder guide! In this website, I hope to teach you how to build your computer and provide you with a better overall understanding of how your 
         computer works and what different components do in it.
      <br> In this website project, I hope to make you feel more comfortable with understanding your computer and its internal hardware by giving you the information you will 
           need to know what each part does and how to assemble your computer yourself. Why build your computer, you may ask. Well, there are many reasons to do this, one would
            be the cost. On average building your computer can cost a few hundred dollars less than buying one that is prebuilt by a large manufacturer. Another reason would be
             that you can customize it to your liking and needs, you can choose what kind of look you want and how much power it can have. Lastly, it is a fun process and with
              a little learning can be quite easy. This website will give you the information that you need to get started with building your computer with a step-by-step guide
               and in-depth detail about what the difference in the hardware you chose can do. </div>
