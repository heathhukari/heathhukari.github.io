<h3>About Me!</h3>
<main>
<p>
    Hello and welcome!
    <br>
    <br> My name is Heath Hukari, I was born in St. Louis, Missouri, but I grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida. I am seeking a degree in Economics at the University of Missouri. For as long as I can remember, I have had a deep passion for technology, I used to take apart old computers and electronics to try to understand how they worked and try to see if I could fix or improve them, and most of the time I would fail at this especially when I was younger, but I learned from it each time.

</blockquote>
    <p>As I started to grow older, I began to learn about how they worked, and I was able to start upgrading and fixing my own tech devices. I love technology and how it's used in our day-to-day lives to connect us all together and improve our lives, from being able to communicate with someone a thousand miles away or being able to perform life-saving surgeries that would be otherwise impossible for humans alone.
