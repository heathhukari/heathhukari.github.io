    Hello, world! My name is Heath Hukari, I was born in St. Louis, Missouri, but I grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida. I am seeking a degree in Economics here at the University of Missouri. I hope to gain from this course a better understanding of how the web pages we use every day are coded, built, and how they work. I also want to learn how to develop my websites, be able to format them to look neat and professional, and have a complete understanding of the whole development process that takes place when creating a website. I learned some HTML coding when I was in elementary and middle school and found it remarkably interesting when I was younger and thought this class would be a wonderful way to continue learning about it. I am excited to start this class and see how well my website will turn out at the end.
